## Description

The social api represents the backend of a social media service. It allows for the creation of user profiles. Those profiles can be viewed as a group or individually pulling them by their unique Ids. User can create "thoughts" that are text entries. User can also give "reactions" to thoughts by other users.

## Usage

The api can be used to manage the backend of a large social media platform. Its Mongo database is a great tool to manage large quantities of data. It is also organized in a readable fashion making it easy for a backend developer to find the information they need.

The needed package to use the application can be installed with an npm i in the root of the directory.
